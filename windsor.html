	<center><h2>The Windsor Knot</h2></center>
	<p style="margin-left:10em; margin-right:10em">Windors knots are definitely an acquired look. They are not your all purpose knot. They are for the modern man who knows they have enough swag to pull it off. They work well with a nice spread collar to really show the girth of the knot. Check out this easy 11 step technique to adding a little more swag to your suit game.</p>
	<ol style="margin-left:10em; margin-right:10em">
		<li>Start with the wide end of the tie on the right and the small end on the left. The tip of the small end should rest slightly above your belly-button. Only move the wide end.</li>
		<li>Wide end over the small end to the left.</li>
		<li>Up into the neck loop from underneath.</li>
		<li>Down to the left.</li>
		<li>Around the back of the small end to the right.</li>
		<li>Up to the center, towards neck loop.</li>
		<li>Through the neck loop and down to the right.</li>
		<li>Across the fron to the left.</li>
		<li>Up into the neck loop from underneath.</li>
		<li>Down through the loop youâ€™ve created in the front.</li>
		<li>Tighten the knot by pulling down on the wide end. Slide the knot up and adjust.</li>
